This repository contains the programs to simulate the evolution of a perturbed infinite vortex sheet in two dimensions. The program mainly solves the discretized Birkhoff-Rott equation. The details of the approach are provided in the documentation PDF file.

This work was presented in the <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/link/BAPS.2014.DFD.G18.2" target="_blank">2014 APS DFD conference</a>.

The state of the vortex sheet after t = 0.98 (non-dimensional) after perturbing with a single primary sinusoidal perturbation:

The state of the vortex sheet after t = 0.98 (non-dimensional) after perturbing also with a secondary sinusoidal perturbation:
